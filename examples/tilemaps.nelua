    and this can be useful on some situations.

    The map, it's a `span` of numbers, and thus it's data points to
    a memory somewhere, thus, it's important to considerate where this
    data it's actually stored because it isn't inside the tilemap.

    For instance, if the code below would be `map = { ... }`, then the map would be
    directly assigned to data.
    This means that the data would be actually stored on the `game` function's stack,
    this means that once the function returns, the data will not be valid anymore (except in case of
    undefined behaviour of course).

    Although this would be not a problem here (because the `game` only returns when the app it's closed),
    it's a better practice to store your data on the top scope as a resource using an data type
    convertible to span (arrays, vector, sequences, anything that's contiguous).

    And that's why the data of tilemap it's declared as an array on the top scope.

    You can read more about how memory works here:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_segment
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_stack

    You can read more about spans on nelua's overview and it's source code:
    https://nelua.io/overview/#span
    https://github.com/edubart/nelua-lang/blob/master/lib/span.nelua

    TL;TR: The `map` field it's a span of numbers, it's better to declare the
    data at the top scope and then assign `map` to this top scope variable than
    assigning the data directly, otherwise you may get undefined behaviour.
