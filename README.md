# nene
Tiny game library build around SDL2 and it's extension libraries (SDL_image, SDL_ttf, SDL_mixer).

Is a very simple game library for simple games, for now, using any library than the SDL2's ones is a
 non-goal.

Some examples are also available on [Rotor-quick](https://github.com/andre-la/rotor-quick), which is
 where `nene` is currently used.
